## üìå Overview

This repository is a collection of self-contained C# console applications developed to reinforce core programming concepts, notably:

- Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Data structures and collections  
- Control flow and algorithms  
- File I/O and persistence  
- Basic abstractions and interfaces  

Originally backed up from an older machine, these projects represent my hands-on practice rather than production-ready code. They‚Äôre organized under the `repos/` folder‚Äîeach directory hosts one focused exercise with its own `Program.cs` entry point.

| Directory                     | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Books**                     | Implements `Book` and `TextBook` classes. Demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and method overrides. |
| **DemoSquare**                | Defines `Square` and `Cube` classes. Shows class hierarchies and overriding to compute surface area. |
| **LocalNewspaper**            | Builds a menu-driven application to create and display various subscriber types via polymorphism.    |
| **Online_Shopping_System**    | Models `Product` hierarchy (`Book`, `Clothing`, `Electronics`) and customer/order logic with interfaces. |
| **TP_Test1_2022**             | Simulates an array of `Vehicle` objects; supports user-driven search and record display.             |
| **University**                | Demonstrates advanced inheritance and interfaces for `Person`‚Äì`Student`‚Äì`Professor`; includes MySQL access. |
