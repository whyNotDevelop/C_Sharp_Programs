## üìå Overview

This repository is a curated collection of C# console applications developed during my journey to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals. Initially serving as a backup due to hardware issues, it has evolved into a showcase of my hands-on practice with C# concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, file I/O, and more.

Each project within the `repos/` directory is self-contained, focusing on specific programming challenges or concepts. While these applications are not production-ready, they reflect my commitment to learning and improving my coding skills.
